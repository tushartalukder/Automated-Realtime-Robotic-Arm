# Automated-Realtime-Robotic-Arm
This is an industrial robotic arm, which will pick different types of objects (only color in this project) and classified with computer vision and then put it in the required box. This whole process will run in real-time . That means whenever the robotic arm finds any object, it will start it's process.
